### Brief about the Project:
We have divided the user into two parts:

1) Admin
2) Users

Our App system is for the users .
And the backend will act as the Admin panel.
Both the ends will be connected to each other.

#### Admin Access Control

The admin will be alloting permission to the user for access any particular
application in that system.

Secondly, If a new add is launched, by default it will be only accessed by the
admin , and if it is present in the user side ,then user can also send edit
request to the admin panel.

Admin will provide the Permissions manaully , no automation is there.
We can further add a feature of acess permssion in accordance to the time of
requirement of the user and need.

#### User accessbility

The System can be used by multiple users at a time.

The user can ask for the permission from the admin by choosing the
applications and one can request to more than one application at once.

They will get notify whether there request is fulfilled or not.
And the user with denial permission can request for permission again.

Additionally, We thought of building an Chat Interface between the user and
the admin ,so they might get to know the reason of deniel ,if felted so.This will
bring trust between the user and admin, hence promoting our website.

#### Features we are providing in the App

* LOGIN/SIGNUP- Login/signup pages are created for multiple users with high password checkup security.

* ACCESS CONTROL- No one otherthan the admin can access a particular application without the permission of admin.

* MULTI FILE SELECTION- At once multiple file can be selected and request can be made for accessing those file, hence will be time saving.
